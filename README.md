# PRELAUNCHER-NODE

Node.js version of Harry's prelaunchr with updated design, comfortable control panel, and other new advanced features. Based on https://github.com/harrystech/prelaunchr and discussed in greater detail on [Tim Ferriss'](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/21/harrys-prelaunchr-email/) blog.
